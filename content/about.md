## Hjowdy. Hejlo.

This website is meant to get you started exploring the world of programming, privacy, security, and anything else you can think of. It's a playground for experimentation and creativity. My only request is that you pursue or do any of these things *only if you want to*. Please feel no obligation to anyone but yourself to learn what you want, when you want. Ho Ho Ho.
